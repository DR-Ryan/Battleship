  √ easy mode = random target selection. 92 possible targets avg 
  √medium mode = random target selection but after a hit search precisely to end that ship. 82 possible target avg
  Used http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/ "a better strategy" to make medium mode.
  Can always change to different mode.

  √hard mode= thinking of the board like a checker board and only targeting one color until a hit. 61 possble targets avg
